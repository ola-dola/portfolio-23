  about: `I'm a software engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria.
   I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between.
   I have been working for 3+ years, mostly building performant web apps at startups. This has helped me to develop deep expertise in technologies like HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, Typescript, React, Next.js, Node/Express, and more.
   In addition to my technical abilities, I have developed a keen understanding of how best to translate business problems into technical solutions using the most optimal path available. 
   The combination of both technical ability and keen eye for business needs makes me shine in product teams that get things done. When I'm not at my desk working, I enjoy quality time with loved ones or a good tv show.
